# GAN_mapping_relationship

This is the implementation of [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00316). 
In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised phoneme recogntion system which can achieve 36% phoneme accuracy on TIMIT with oracle phone boundaries.
This method developed a GAN-based model to achieve unsupervised phoneme recognition.

## How to use

### Dependencies
1. tensorflow 1.13

2. kaldi

3. srilm (can be built with kaldi/tools/install_srilm.sh)

4. librosa

### Data preprocess
- Usage:

1. Modify `path.sh` with your path of Kaldi and srilm.
2. Modify `config.sh` with your feature path and timit path.
3. Run `$ bash preprocess.sh`

- Phoneme sequences can download from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rux7tnr0n6k6n33/phn_seq.tar.gz?dl=0), and put `target.39` and `oracle.39` in `./data`.

### Train model
- Usage:

1. Modify the experimental and path setting in `config.sh`.
2. Modify the model's parameter in `src/audio2vec.sh` and `src/mapping.sh`.
2. Run `$ bash run.sh`

- This scipt contains the training flow of whole system.
